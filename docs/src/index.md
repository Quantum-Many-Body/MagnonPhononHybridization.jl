*Magnon-phonon hybridized systems.*

## Introduction

Magnon-phonon hybridization in magnetically ordered quantum lattice systems is based on the [QuantumLattices](https://github.com/Quantum-Many-Body/QuantumLattices.jl) pack, the [TightBindingApproximation](https://github.com/Quantum-Many-Body/TightBindingApproximation.jl) pack, and the [SpinWaveTheory](https://github.com/Quantum-Many-Body/SpinWaveTheory.jl) pack.

## Installation

In Julia **v1.8+**, please type `]` in the REPL to use the package mode, then type this command:

```julia
pkg> add MagnonPhononHybridization
```

## Note

Due to the fast development of this package, releases with different minor version numbers are **not** guaranteed to be compatible with previous ones **before** the release of v1.0.0. Comments are welcomed in the issues.
